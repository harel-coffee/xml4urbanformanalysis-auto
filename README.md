# Using xml to understand how urban form shapes sustainable mobility in Berlin

Abstract
Municipalities are increasingly acknowledging the importance of urban form interventions that can reduce intra-city car travel
in achieving more sustainable cities. Current academic knowledge for supporting such policies falls short in providing the
spatial details required to plan specific interventions. Here, we develop an explainable machine learning framework to identify
location-specific relevance of built environment for urban motorized travel, using a sample of 3.5 million car commutes over
one year in Berlin and high-resolution urban form data. Results demonstrate that subcenters play a vital role in reducing
commuting-related travel distance, giving support to the 15-minute city hypothesis. Observed threshold effects of induced
CO2 emissions require low-carbon-policies targeted towards densifying the inner city while releasing peripheral low income
communities from car dependence. This research provides a starting point for increasingly rich big data analyses of urban form
for creating low-carbon and inclusive urban planning strategies.


This repository includes all code necessary to calculate the presented results in the manuscript entitled "Using explainable machine learning to understand how urban form shapes sustainable mobility in Berlin":
- ufo_map: a repository for calculating urban form metrics developed by the authors of this paper at TU Berlin and MCC   
- urbanformvmt: a repository containing the project speific files including one 'main' file that summarises the pipeline.
